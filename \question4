Automated Banking System Using Agile
1. Abstract (300–400 Words)

The Automated Banking System project aims to provide customers with secure, reliable, and efficient online banking services. Traditional banking systems involve manual processes that consume time, require physical presence, and often lead to delays and human errors. With the growth of digital technology, there is a strong need for an automated system that allows customers to perform banking operations anytime and anywhere. This project is developed using the Agile methodology, which ensures flexibility, faster development, and continuous improvement based on stakeholder feedback.

The Automated Banking System includes features such as user registration, secure login, account management, balance inquiry, fund transfer, transaction history, and report generation. Agile development divides the project into small iterations called sprints. Each sprint delivers a functional module, such as authentication, account details, or transaction processing. Continuous testing and regular feedback help improve system quality and security.

The system reduces the workload of bank staff and improves customer satisfaction by providing 24×7 access to banking services. It ensures data accuracy, transparency, and security through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily meetings, sprint review, and retrospective help the development team identify risks early and enhance system performance. The Automated Banking System is scalable and can be enhanced further with mobile banking, biometric authentication, and integration with digital payment platforms. This project demonstrates the effective use of Agile methodology in developing a secure and customer-centric banking solution.

2. Introduction
