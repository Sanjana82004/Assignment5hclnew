Online E-Commerce Website Using Agile
1. Abstract (300–400 Words)

The Online E-Commerce Website project is designed to facilitate online buying and selling of products through a secure and user-friendly platform. Traditional shopping methods limit customer choice and require physical presence. This project applies Agile methodology to develop an adaptable and customer-focused e-commerce solution.

Agile development allows the project to be built incrementally, starting with core features such as product listing and user registration, followed by advanced features like shopping cart, online payment, and order tracking. Continuous customer feedback helps improve usability and performance. The system ensures secure transactions, efficient inventory management, and faster order processing.

The e-commerce website provides benefits to both customers and sellers by offering convenience, wider reach, and real-time updates. Agile practices ensure timely delivery and quality enhancement. The system is scalable and suitable for small and large businesses. Future enhancements include mobile app support and AI-based product recommendations.
